# 🌍 civilization-sim

Hey! I'm **ZyxxTheDev** — I saw a cool TikTok about a girl being the daughter of God and got inspired to create this project. So here's a **simulated civilization** game that starts with just two people (Adam and Eve) and evolves into a full human world across eras!

I'll be updating this regularly. If you have suggestions or want to collaborate, reach out on Discord: **zyxx.on.top**
